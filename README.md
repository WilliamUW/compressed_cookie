# CRUMBS - The future of cookies
 Our mission is to empower individuals to take control of their data privacy and ownership by leveraging Solana's compressed NFTs to control who has permission to use their information. We aim to establish a standard of data ownership to create a more equitable and sustainable digital ecosystem, where users are not exploited for their personal information, but instead are able to benefit from their data in a fair and meaningful way.

CRUMBS is a [LionHacks](https://lionhack.xyz/) project in the Solana track!
